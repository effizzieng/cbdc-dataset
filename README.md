This dataset was paid and pulled from Twitter to conduct an academic sentiment analysis with 10 algorithms.


**Classical Machine Learning Models**
Logistic Regression: Often used as a baseline model for sentiment classification tasks.
Support Vector Machines (SVMs): Popular for text classification, including sentiment analysis.
Naive Bayes: A simple probabilistic classifier that works well for text classification tasks like sentiment analysis.
Random Forest: An ensemble learning method used for classification tasks, including sentiment analysis.
Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs): Such as XGBoost or LightGBM, which are powerful classifiers for sentiment analysis tasks.
**Neural Network Models**
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Networks): Recurrent neural networks that are particularly useful for sequential data like text in sentiment analysis.
GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit Networks): Similar to LSTMs but with a simpler structure, often used for text classification tasks.
CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks): While typically used for image data, CNNs can be applied to text classification by treating text as a sequence of word embeddings.
RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks): General recurrent models used in sequence-based tasks like sentiment analysis.
Transformers: The backbone of BERT and GPT models, useful for capturing complex patterns in text data for sentiment analysis.
